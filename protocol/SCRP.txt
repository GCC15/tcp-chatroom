This is the specification of the Stupid Chat Room Protocol (SCRP), a lightweight
application-layer communication protocol used in the project tcp-chatroom
(https://github.com/GCC15/tcp-chatroom). The SCRP is designed to work together
with other protocols including TLS/TCP/IP, although it is completely independent
of the underlying protocols.

1. Concepts

  This section defines abstract entities and the fields needed to describe the
  state and properties of each of them. The name, the data type, the meaning,
  and the definition of validity of each field are specified.

  1.1 SCRP system

    An SCRP system consists of a server and some clients.

  1.2 Server

    The server is a computer program which handles requests from clients.

      A human-readable name of the server, e.g. "My Awesome Server". length <=
      32.

    Version (ASCII string)

      The version of the server, e.g. "1.0.0". length <= 16.

    Description (Unicode string)

      The description of the server. length <= 256.

    Protocol version (ASCII string)

      The version of SCRP followed by the server, e.g. "1.0.0". length <= 16.

      interpretation of "raw data" is implementation-dependent.

    Data out (uint64)

      Amount of raw data sent in bytes since the server started. The
      interpretation of "raw data" is implementation-dependent.

  1.3 Client

    A client is a computer program which communicates with the server on behalf
    of a user. Clients include but are not limited to general-purpose GUI
    applications and automated scripts.

    Nickname (Unicode string)

      A human-readable name of the client, e.g. "My Awesome Client". length <=
      32.

    Version (ASCII string)

      The version of the client, e.g. "1.0.0". length <= 16.

    Protocol version (ASCII string)

      The version of SCRP followed by the client, e.g. "1.0.0". length <= 16.

    Time (uint32)

      The current timestamp as seen from the client.

  1.4 User

    A user chats (a) with its friends, and (b) in rooms.

    ID (ASCII string)

      The identifier of the user, e.g. "john_42". It is valid if and only if (a)
      1 <= length <= 16, (b) it only contains alphanumeric characters
      (case-sensitive) and/or underscore(s), and (c) it is unique.

      valid if and only if (a) 6 <= length <= 64, and (b) it only contains
      printable ASCII characters, i.e. ASCII code 32 - 126 (0x20 - 0x7E).

    Nickname (Unicode string)

      Each user has zero or more friends.

    Rooms (collection of room)

      Each user belongs to zero or more rooms.

    Mode (enum int)
    The mode determines condition of the user.
      There are currently 2 modes.

      ON = 0

        User is logged in.

      OFF = 1

        User is logged off.

  1.5 Room

    A room consists of one or more users. Users send messages in the room.

    ID (ASCII string)

      The identifier of the room. It is valid if and only if (a) 1 <= length <=
      16, (b) it only contains alphanumeric characters (case-sensitive) and/or
      underscore(s), and (c) it is unique.

    Nickname (Unicode string)

      A human-readable name of the room. 1 <= length <= 32.

    Description (Unicode string)

      The description of the room. length <= 256.

    Creator (user)

      The user who owns the room. The room creator has the greatest power in the
      room. Each room must have one creator.

    Admins (collection of user)

      An admin administrates the room. Room admins are appointed by the room
      creator. Room admins have more power than general users but less power
      than the room creator. A room has zero or more admins.

    Password (ASCII string)

      The room password can be optionally set to prevent undesired users from
      entering the room. It is valid if and only if (a) 6 <= length <= 64,
      and (b) it only contains printable ASCII characters, i.e. ASCII code 32 -
      126 (0x20 - 0x7E).

    Access type (enum int)

      The access type determines the condition for users to enter the room.
      There are 3 access types.

      ROOM_ACCESS_PUBLIC = 0

        Any user can enter the room unconditionally.

      ROOM_ACCESS_PASSWORD = 1

        A user can enter the room if and only if the correct password is
        presented.

      ROOM_ACCESS_PERMISSION = 2

        A user can enter the room with the permission of the creator or any
        admin in the room.

  1.6 Room message

    Room messages are what users send in a room. All other users in the same
    room at the time the message was sent can see the message.

    ID (uint32)

      The identifier of the message. It is unique among all messages.

    Time (uint32)

      The server time when the message was received by the server.

    Sender (user)

      The user who sent the message.

    Target room (room)

      The room in which the message was sent.

  1.7 Private message

    A private message is what a user sends to one of its friends. Only the
    specific receiver can see the message.

    ID (uint32)

      The identifier of the message. It is unique among all messages.

    Time (uint32)

      The server time when the message was received by the server.

    Sender (user)

      The user who sent the message.

    Receiver (user)

      The user to whom the message was sent.


2. Request & Response

  Requests are what a client sends to the server. A request is represented by a
  JSON dictionary which contains the following fields.

    (a) req_id (uint32)

      The serial number of the request. It is unique among all requests from the
      same client in the same session:

    (b) method (string)

      The method name of the request (case-sensitive).

    (c) Other fields dependent on the method.

  The server must sends a response to each request from a client. A response 
  is represented by a JSON dictionary which contains the following fields.

    (a) resp_id (uint32)

      The req_id of the request that the server is responding to.

    (b) Other fields dependent on the request method, including an err field,
        which represents the error type of the response, defined in Section 3.

  All SCRP request methods are defined below. For each method, the name, the
  JSON data type, and the meaning of each request field and each response field
  are specified. The algorithm for the server to process each request is also
  specified.

3. Error

  Each type of error has an error number, a name, and a description.

  Note: The algorithms specified in Section 2 and the error numbers in this
  section are designed so that when the requirements of multiple errors are met
  simultaneously, the server must respond with the error with the smallest error
  number. This suggests that the server should usually check for errors in
  ascending order of error numbers, whenever necessary.

  233 BAD_REQUEST

    The request was not understood because it violates the SCRP specification
    (the version followed by the server) to a large extent, and was thus
    ignored.

  250 LOG_IN_FIRST

    The server refuses to process the request because the client should log in
    first before sending the request.

  300 INVALID_USER_ID

    The format of the user ID is invalid.

  301 INVALID_ROOM_ID

    The format of the room ID is invalid.

  310 INVALID_USER_PASS

    The format of the user password is invalid.

  311 INVALID_ROOM_PASS

    The format of the room password is invalid.

  320 INALID_USER_NICKNAME

    The format of the user nickname is invalid.

  321 INVALID_ROOM_NICKNAME

    The format of the room nickname is invalid.

  TODO: Other 3xx invalid errors. descriptions, nickname, etc...

  Note: Errors with error number smaller than 400 never occurs if the client
  follows this specification.

  400 USER_ALREADY_EXISTS

    The user ID already exists.

  401 ROOM_ALREADY_EXISTS

    The Room ID already exists.

  402 TOO_MANY_WRONG_ATTEMPTS

    Wrong attempts are too often.

  403 WRONG_USER_PASS

    The user ID and the user password do not match.

  404 USER_ALREADY_LOGGED_IN

    The user is already logged.

  TODO: Other errors


  900 SUCCESS

    The requested action was performed without errors.

  999 UNKNOWN

    An unexpected error occurred.

    Note: This error never occurs if the server is properly developed and
    follows this specification. The client can assume that this error never
    occurs.
