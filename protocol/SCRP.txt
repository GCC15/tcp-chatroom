This is the specification of Stupid Chat Room Protocol (SCRP), a lightweight
application-layer communication protocol used in the project tcp-chatroom
(https://github.com/GCC15/tcp-chatroom). SCRP is designed to work together
with TLS/TCP/IP, although it is completely independent of the underlying
protocols.

1. Concepts

  In this section abstract concepts and related quantities are defined.

  1.1 SCRP system

    An SCRP system consists of a server and some clients.

  1.2 Server

    The server is a computer program which handles requests from clients, and
    manages users, messages, rooms, and their interactions.

    Server nickname (Unicode string)

      A human-readable name of the server, e.g. "My Awesome Server". length
      <= 16.

    Server version (ASCII string)

      The version of the server, e.g. "1.0.0". length <= 16.

    Server description (Unicode string)

      A description of the server. length <= 256.

    Server protocol version (ASCII string)

      The version of SCRP followed by the server, e.g. "1.0.0". length <= 16.

    Server time (uint32)

      The current timestamp as seen from the server.

    Server uptime (uint32)

      The timestamp when the server started running.

    Number of users (uint32)

      Number of currently registered users.

    Max number of users (uint32)

      The maximum number of users since the server started.

    Number of online users (uint32)

      Number of registered users currently online.

    Max number of online users (uint32)

      The maximum number of online users since the server started.

    Number of rooms (uint32)

      (Omitted)

    Max number of rooms (uint32)

      The maximum number of rooms since the server started.

    Number of messages received (uint32)

      (Omitted)

    Number of messages sent (uint32)

      (Omitted)

    Amount of raw data received in bytes (uint64)

      The interpretation of "raw data" is implementation-dependent.

    Amount of raw data sent in bytes (uint64)

      The interpretation of "raw data" is implementation-dependent.

  1.3 Client

    A client is a computer program which communicates with the server on
    behalf of a user. It can be a general-purpose GUI program, or an automated
    or semi-automated script.

    Client nickname (Unicode string)

      A human-readable name of the client, e.g. "My Awesome Client". length
      <= 16.

    Client version (ASCII string)

      The version of the client, e.g. "1.0.0". length <= 16.

    Client description (Unicode string)

      A description of the client. length <= 256.

    Client protocol version (ASCII string)

      The version of SCRP followed by the client, e.g. "1.0.0". length <= 16.

    Client time (uint32)

      The current timestamp as seen from the client.

  1.4 User

    A user chats (a) with one of its friends, and (b) in a room.

    User ID (ASCII string)

      The identifier of the user, e.g. "john_42". It is valid if and only if (a)
      1 <= length <= 16, (b) it only contains alphanumeric characters
      (case-sensitive) and/or underscore(s), and (c) it is unique.

    User password (ASCII string)

      The login credential of the user, e.g. "my_very_secure_password". It is
      valid if and only if (a) 6 <= length <= 64, and (b) it only contains
      printable ASCII characters, i.e. ASCII code 32 - 126 (0x20 - 0x7E).

    User nickname (Unicode string)

      A human-readable name of the user, e.g. "John Doe". It is valid if and
      only if 1 <= length <= 16.

    User description (Unicode string)

      The description of the user. length <= 256.

    User sign up time (uint32)

      The server time when the user signed up on the server.
      
    Friends (collection of user)
    
      A set of zero or more other users.

  1.5 Room

    A room consists of one or more user. Users send messages in the room.

      ROOM_ACCESS_PUBLIC

      ROOM_ACCESS_PASSWORD

      ROOM_ACCESS_PERMISSION

    Room admin

      A special type of user in the room. A room has one or more admins.

  1.6 Message

    A message is what a user sends into a room. All other users in the same
    room at the time the message was sent can see the message.

    Message ID

    Message Room ID

      The Room ID of the room in which the message was sent.

    Message time

      The server time when the message was received by the server.

    Message sender
