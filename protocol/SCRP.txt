1. Concepts

  1.1 SCRP System

    An SCRP system consists of one server and zero or more clients.

  1.2 Server

    The server is a computer program which handles requests from clients, and
    manages users, messages, chatrooms, and their interactions.

    1.2.1 Server nickname (Unicode string)

      A short human-readable name of the server, e.g. "My Awesome Server".

    1.2.2 Server version (ASCII string)

      The version of the server, e.g. "1.0.0".

    1.2.3 Server description (Unicode string)

      A description of the server.

    1.2.4 Server protocol version (ASCII string)

      The version of SCRP followed by the server, e.g. "1.0.0".

    1.2.5 Server time (integer)

      The current timestamp as seen from the server.

    1.2.6 Server uptime (integer)

      The timestamp when the server started running.

    1.2.7 Number of users (integer)

    1.2.8 Max number of users (integer)

      The maximum number of users since the server started.

    1.2.9 Number of online users (integer)

    1.2.10 Max number of online users (integer)

      The maximum number of online users since the server started.

    1.2.11 Number of rooms (integer)

    1.2.12 Max number of rooms (integer)

      The maximum number of rooms since the server started.

    1.2.13 Number of messages received (integer)

    1.2.14 Number of messages sent (integer)

    1.2.15 Amount of raw data received in bytes (integer)

      The interpretation of "raw data" can be implementation-dependent.

    1.2.16 Amount of raw data sent in bytes (integer)

      The interpretation of "raw data" can be implementation-dependent.

  1.3 Client

    A client is a computer program, usually with a UI. It receives inputs from
    a human (a user) and communicates with the server accordingly.

    1.3.1 Client nickname (Unicode string)

      A short human-readable name of the client, e.g. "My Awesome Client".

    1.3.2 Client version (ASCII string)

      The version of the client, e.g. "1.0.0".

    1.3.3 Client description (Unicode string)

      A description of the client.

    1.3.4 Client protocol version (ASCII string)

      The version of SCRP followed by the client, e.g. "1.0.0".

    1.3.5 Client time (integer)

      The current timestamp as seen from the client.

  1.4 User

    1.4.1 User ID (ASCII string)
